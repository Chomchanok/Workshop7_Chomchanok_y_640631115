   First of all, you need to download file Workshop7_640631115.ipynb and then you can open it either on google colab or jupyter editor ant etc.
This workshop is about simulation of model prediction by using machine learning from scikit learn and dataset is Iris dataset which was provided on www.kaggle.com 
In this workshop i train model by using KNeighborsClassifier algorithm from scikit learn to compare the result of accuracy scores from experiment random choosing KNN value and calculate distance of KNN by using euclidean matric, and to compare KNN model with using other classification techniques such as, Logistic regression and Gaussian naive bays

The example of program input and processes are as follows:
1. Iris.csv file which contains features as SepalLengthCm, SepalWidthCm,	PetalLengthCm, PetalWidthCm and species 
2. then split dataset to be traning set and test set	
3. train model by using KNN 
4. plot results
5. compare results

The example of program output is the number of species of Iris flowers via confusion matrix which were predicted to be such as, Iris-setosa, Iris-versicolor or Iris-virginica,
then show the precision and accuracy of models via classification report
